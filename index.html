        <h2>Trick or Treat!</h2>
        <p>
            Trick or treating may seem like a modern event, but you can trace its roots back to Celtic Britain and Ireland in the 9th century. .
            .. It's believed that trick or treating evolved from a ritual where people dressed as ghosts and demons, performed dances around a 
            bonfire and received treats to appease the evil spirits.
